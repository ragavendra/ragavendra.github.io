The SAP tests framework and the tools were developed to help create and provision the smart meters in the system with verification checks across integrated systems. 

 

Data Mining tool 

Developed to fetch the smart meter data across the three main systems in the smart meter technology. The three main systems the SAP-ISU, Meter Data Management system and the Openway Collection Engine system data using the Oracle databases were joined effectively. It was used for the test data purposes, data concurrency checks and to identify the meter grouping based on its type. 

The tool's architecture is flexible to be reused for different Utilities vendor implementation as well as it uses the SAP SQVI JOIN of ISU Standard data tables for the smart meter data retrieval. 

 

Cisco routers configuration automation script 

Developed to configure the routers based on the vendor specific configurations. 

Can be invoked to perform router configuration updates on multiple routers in sequence or in concurrency 

 

Cisco routers memory leak monitor application 

Developed to connect and fetch memory data periodically from the router. 

The memory leak data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to analyze and evaluate the memory leak 

 

Cisco routers time latency check application 

Developed to connect and fetch time periodically from the router. 

The time data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to evaluate the time latency. Apparently the time lag would cause the router to reboot and the lag delta needed to be identified and reported to the firmware department to be fixed. 

 

Independent scripts or tests launcher 

Developed to launch, load and run the automated tests. It was scheduled for the daily run and the output test results were in the JSON format for the Node.JS app to pick it up and report.

The first tier being the tests, then the object declaration and the final is the object repository. Keyword driven architecture was used. Data was taken from the data pool having mostly CSV or XLS data format. RFT scripting was done to test the application in the regression and the system testing phase. Objects were maintained in a separate module to help make them reusable for many scripts. Regular expressions were used for optimizing the objects and at verification points.
